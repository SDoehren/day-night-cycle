Day Night Cycle automatically changes the lighting levels to reflect the time of day based on the time in [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar).

## Future of Day Night Cycle

Day Night Cycle has been updated to V10.

Going forwards Day Night Cycle should be treated as unsupported.

I will continue to develop Day Night Cycle for my own games so major bugs will be fixed, but edge cases will take longer to get to.

## Install 

Available on the Forge and via the module directory within Foundry.

Alternatively install via the manifest url: https://github.com/SDoehren/day-night-cycle/releases/latest/download/module.json

[Simple Calendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) and [lib-wrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) are the dependencies for this module.

## Instructions

Default settings can be changed within the module settings.  

The activation and day night cycle can be controlled on a scene-by-scene basis within scene configure menu.

The effects of changing the settings can be seen [here](https://sdoehren.com/daynightcycle)
